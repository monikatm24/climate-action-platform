## Project Title
**Renewable Energy Adoption and Carbon Emission Reduction Platform**

## Problem Statement
India’s renewable energy targets and carbon neutrality goals face challenges such as high upfront costs, grid integration constraints, slow rural electrification, and fragmented carbon reporting. Small businesses and local governments lack digital tools for **real-time monitoring** and decision-making. This platform provides a **scalable, digital, and automation-driven solution** to:  
1. Accelerate renewable energy deployment across regions.  
2. Enable real-time tracking and transparent reporting of carbon metrics.  
3. Bridge the gap between national renewable energy targets and local-level implementation for effective climate mitigation.

## Description of AI Usage
The platform integrates an **LLM (Large Language Model)** to provide **policy and financing guidance** for renewable energy projects. Users input project details such as type, capacity, and investment, and the AI:  
- Evaluates **eligibility for central/state subsidies**  
- Suggests **grid connection and PPA considerations**  
- Provides **concise, actionable recommendations** for local project implementation  

This demonstrates **AI-powered decision support**, reducing manual research and enabling timely climate action.

## Tech Stack Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript  
- **AI Integration:** LLM API (for project policy guidance)  
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages / Vercel (optional live demo)  
- **Tools:** VS Code, GitHub, Browser-based execution  
- **Additional Libraries:** None (pure client-side JS for simulations and dashboard)

## How to Use
1. Open the website in a browser  
2. Use the **Project Simulator** to input renewable energy project parameters  
3. View AI-powered policy guidance and estimated CO2 reduction  
4. Submit monthly emissions data in the **Carbon Tracking Dashboard**  
5. Review the dashboard and submission history for transparent reporting
